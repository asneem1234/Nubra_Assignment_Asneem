#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user initiates the transition process THEN the system SHALL provide a guided onboarding flow
2. WHEN a user creates their first algorithm THEN the system SHALL offer templates based on their manual trading patterns
3. WHEN a user tests an algorithm THEN the system SHALL provide paper trading capabilities before live execution
4. WHEN a user runs an algorithm THEN the system SHALL allow manual override and monitoring capabilities
5. IF an algorithm performs unexpectedly THEN the system SHALL provide alerts and automatic stop mechanisms

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a platform user, I want to see how Nubra compares to other backtesting and algo-trading platforms, so that I can understand the competitive advantages.

#### Acceptance Criteria

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user runs a backtest THEN the system SHALL provide historical data spanning multiple market conditions
2. WHEN backtesting completes THEN the system SHALL display comprehensive performance metrics and visualizations
3. WHEN a user analyzes results THEN the system SHALL highlight potential risks and optimization opportunities

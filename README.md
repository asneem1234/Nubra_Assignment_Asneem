# Nubra Product Intern Assignment

This repository contains my completed assignment for the Nubra Product Intern position. The project focuses on designing a feature that helps manual traders transition to algorithmic trading through a user-friendly and confidence-building interface.

## 📋 Assignment Requirements

1. ✅ Signed up for a Nubra demat/sign-in account
2. ✅ Created UI/UX suggestions for improvement of Nubra web/app modules
3. ✅ Conducted competitor analysis on backtesting and algo-trading platforms
4. ✅ Proposed a feature to help manual traders switch to algo/automated trading
5. ✅ Created wireframes and implementation for the proposed feature

## 🚀 My Solution: "Algo Transition Suite"

My proposal is the **Algo Transition Suite** - a comprehensive system designed to guide manual traders into algorithmic trading through confidence-building interfaces and personalized experiences.

### Core Components

1. **Shadow Trading Dashboard**
   - Runs algorithms in parallel with manual trades
   - Provides real-time comparison of decisions
   - Builds confidence through transparent performance metrics

2. **Trading DNA Analyzer**
   - Analyzes user's trading patterns and behaviors
   - Creates personalized algorithms matching the trader's style
   - Provides insight into trading psychology and habits

3. **Enhanced Options Chain Interface**
   - Simplified view with visual hierarchy
   - Color-coded ITM/OTM/ATM options
   - Mobile-optimized experience

### 🌟 Key Differentiators

- First platform specifically designed for manual-to-algo transition
- Personalized approach based on individual trading patterns
- Risk-free confidence building through shadow trading
- Mobile-optimized interfaces for modern traders

## 📊 Competitive Analysis

I analyzed major competitors in the backtesting and algo-trading space:

| Platform | Strengths | Weaknesses |
|----------|-----------|------------|
| Zerodha Streak | Simple interface, Indian market focus | Limited backtesting depth |
| TradingView | Excellent charts, global markets | Limited Indian market integration |
| Interactive Brokers | Powerful API, global access | Complex interface, high minimum balance |
| Upstox Algo | Low cost, mobile-friendly | Basic features, limited customization |

## 🎨 Implementation Details

### HTML/CSS Prototype

The project includes working HTML/CSS prototypes for:

- **index.html**: Main landing page showcasing the feature
- **shadow-trading.html**: Shadow Trading Dashboard interface
- **trading-dna.html**: Trading DNA Analysis interface
- **options-chain.html**: Enhanced Options Chain interface

### Implementation Timeline

1. **Phase 1 (2-3 weeks)**: Core UI/UX Improvements
2. **Phase 2 (3-4 weeks)**: Shadow Trading System
3. **Phase 3 (2-3 weeks)**: Trading DNA & Confidence System

## 📱 Mobile Experience

The interfaces are designed with mobile users in mind, featuring:

- Responsive layouts that adapt to different screen sizes
- Touch-friendly controls and swipeable interfaces
- Simplified views optimized for smaller screens

## 🔍 Technical Feasibility

The proposed features could be implemented with:

- **Frontend**: React/Vue.js with responsive design
- **Backend**: Node.js/Python for analysis algorithms
- **Database**: PostgreSQL for trade data and patterns
- **Real-time**: WebSocket for live comparisons
- **Mobile**: Progressive Web App (PWA) approach
